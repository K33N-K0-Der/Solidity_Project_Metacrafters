This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a simple token called MyToken. The contract includes basic functionalities for minting and burning tokens.

## Description
The MyToken contract is designed to demonstrate basic token operations on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes the following features:

1. Public variables to store details about the token:

-> Token Name

-> Token Abbreviation

-> Total Supply

2. A mapping to keep track of balances associated with each address.

3. A mint function to increase the total supply and the balance of a specified address.

4. A burn function to decrease the total supply and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure the balance is sufficient to burn the specified amount.
